Xojo-iOSLib (v2)
===========

A library extending Xojo's iOS features by adding extension modules and classes.
This is a restart of the iOSLib project, now 64bit compatible and started from scratch. 
iOSLib tries to implement declared features completely transparent to Xojo, which means you can use many of the extended features by just copying the lib to your project and using the extension modules, only handling Xojo classes.
If you want to dig deeper into iOS, you can always address the API features on a class level and use all the bells and whistles.
You are very welcome to send additions, declares or more convenience methods that create a native Xojo-like feeling for the declare routines.
