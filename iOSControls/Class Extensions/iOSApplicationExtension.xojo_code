	#tag Note, Name = Read Me
		This is iOSApplication, an extension for Xojo iOS adding UIApplication features to an iOS App.
		
		You will find that the properties-as-methods refer to separate protected methods. 
		While this may seem complicated, you can always use them in your own classes in case you need to call them on a different object than id/handle.
		Hopefully this will help saving you from recreating the same lines of code again and again.
		
		This is part of the iOSControls library for easy-to-use Xojo iOS,extensions, hopefully to find soon on xojoblog.me.
		
		* Important *
		If you want to have a feedback on the view animations, in other words have an animationfinished event fire when transition has completed, 
		you need to replace your iOSView by UIView which is a subclass of it but with additional help properties and methods I could not attach to a module.
		
		
		
		Disclaimer
		This software is delivered AS IS. You are free to use it in your project, modify it according to your needs and you are very welcome to share your contributions too.
		I can not guarantee for data loss, computer problems and all that stuff that may arise from using the classes and methods, but I do guarantee that I use them myself
		in my projects and have not experienced such. Therefore the usual legal warning: Use at your own risk!
		
		
		Copyright
		Written 2014 by Ulrich Bogun, xojoblog.me. This is a private project not connected to my job as german Xojo evangelist.
		This all is only possible because of the tremendous help of some extraordinary gurus sharing their wisdom on forum.xojo.com and, of course, the guys behind MacOSLib.
		Therefore a copyright would be very stange and wrong. Again: iOSCOntrols are free to use and modify.
		
		However, you surely can imagine this took me (and will probably take) a lot of time, and I want to continue refining the classes and adding more to them.
		If you use the classes and find them useful, feel absolutely free to send me a "keep it up"-contribution via PayPal to bogun@satzservice.de.
		The amount is completely up to you and every sum will be appreciated regardless of its height.
		If you cannot afford a few bucks or don't want to: Hey, that's still ok!
		Maybe you like to send me a line about their use or add a "Uses iOSControls …" line to your splashscreen.
		And if not you’re still not a bad guy. Enjoy, share, contribute.
